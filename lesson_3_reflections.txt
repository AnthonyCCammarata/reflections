When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
When collaborating with others, or working across multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It may update with incomplete features, or something that isnâ€™t ready for release.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  
When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy sork to a new place so your commited changes don't change the original. 
Clones are similar but will change the original with commits.
Branches allow you to add new functionallity that can be merged with the original later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
It allows up-to-date offline working.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  
What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would send files back and forth and have to merge them manually.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  
What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to work on a feature that isn't production quality yet. When other people are working from master, you don't want to change the basis of their work.
