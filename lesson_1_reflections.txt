How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me the time saving ability of the software.
It found all the changes without me hunting through the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help me to pinpoint the location of unintentional changes in code.
It would give me a base to fall back on if the updated code had issues.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: 
All changes will be meaningful.
All changes will be complete.
Cons:
May be commited too often or too infrequently.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is made for coding, and coding often requires changes to multiple files at a time.
Google Docs is made more for work on individual files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log will show all of the commits with their description.
git diff will show what was added and what was removed between two specific commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It makes me much more confident. 
I can always revert back to an old version if I break the current one.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Android apps. Probably everything else.
